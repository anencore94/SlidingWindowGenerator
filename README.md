# SlidingWindowGenerator
- based on tensorflow v2.3.0
    - use [timeseries_dataset_from_array function](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/preprocessing/timeseries_dataset_from_array) which was introduced in tf v2.3.0 
- This module converts time series data from dataframe type to sliding window type
    - to use as input in RNN based layer
- This module was based on [tensorflow official docs](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/structured_data/time_series#data_windowing), just aggregate some functions and add small tuning to use it more efficiently.
    - to make it possible to control batch_size, sequence_stride_size and shuffle more freely.

# QuickStart

### 1) Install this module with pip 

```shell
pip install slidingwindw_generator
```

### 2) How to Import

```
from slidingwindow_generator.slidingwindow_generator import SlidingWindowGenerator

SlidingWindowGenerator(...)
```

### 3) Detailed Example

- you can see detailed example with real data and RNN in `./tests/example.ipynb`
